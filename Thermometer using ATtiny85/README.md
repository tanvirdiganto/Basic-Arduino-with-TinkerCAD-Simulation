# Thermometer using ATtiny85 Microcontroller 🌡️

This project demonstrates how to build a compact **digital thermometer** using the ultra-low-power **ATtiny85** microcontroller and an **LM35 temperature sensor**. Based on the sensed temperature, an LED provides visual feedback using different blink patterns — a simple and efficient solution for minimal-display or wearable applications.

## 🔧 Required Components

- ATtiny85 microcontroller  
- LM35 Temperature Sensor (or compatible analog sensor)  
- LED  
- Resistor (220Ω or 330Ω)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard or minimal circuit board  
- USBasp programmer (or similar, to upload code to ATtiny85)

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔍 Analog Temperature Sensing

- The **LM35 sensor** is connected to **analog pin A1 (PB2)** of the ATtiny85.
- It outputs an analog voltage: **10mV per °C**.

### 🔢 Temperature Conversion

- The analog input is converted into voltage.
- Voltage is translated to temperature in Celsius and then to Fahrenheit using:

  ```text
  Temp (°C) = (Voltage - 0.5) * 100  
  Temp (°F) = (Temp °C * 9 / 5) + 32
  ```

## 🚨 LED Blink Patterns Based on Temperature

| Temperature Range    | Description | LED Behavior        |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| ≤ 68°F               | Cold        | Slow Blink (1s)     |
| 70°F – 116°F         | Moderate    | Normal Blink (0.5s) |
| 123°F – 238°F        | Hot         | Fast Blink (0.1s)   |
| Any other reading    | Warning     | Solid ON            |

This system allows users to quickly gauge the temperature without a display.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The **ATtiny85** reads analog voltage from the **LM35**.
- After conversion and calibration, the program checks the range and updates LED behavior.
- **No external display** is needed — LED blinks give instant feedback.
- Great for ultra-low-power environments and wearable tech.

## 📦 Applications

- Basic environmental temperature monitoring  
- Wearables or compact gadgets  
- Display-less sensor nodes  
- Educational microcontroller projects  
- Low-cost room or outdoor thermometers
