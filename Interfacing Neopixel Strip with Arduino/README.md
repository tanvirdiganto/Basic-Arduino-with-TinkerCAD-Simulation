# üåà Interfacing NeoPixel Strip with Arduino

This project shows how to interface a **NeoPixel LED strip** (WS2812B) with an **Arduino** to create dynamic lighting effects. Using the **Adafruit NeoPixel library**, we implement a colorful chasing light animation, ideal for decorative lighting, wearables, or interactive displays.

## üß∞ Required Components
- Arduino board (e.g., **Uno**, **Mega**)
- **NeoPixel LED strip** (WS2812B or similar)
- **5V power supply** (capable of handling the LED strip's current)
- **Jumper wires**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The **NeoPixel strip** is connected to a digital pin on the Arduino.
2. The strip is initialized using the **Adafruit NeoPixel** library.
3. The `loop()` function continuously calls a `chase()` function that:
   - Lights up LEDs one by one.
   - Creates a **moving light effect**.
   - Cycles through different **colors** dynamically.
4. The `setPixelColor()` function sets each individual LED‚Äôs color.
5. The `show()` function updates the strip to reflect changes.
6. A small delay (`delay(100)`) ensures a smooth, visible motion.

## üîç Working Principle

- The **Adafruit NeoPixel library** simplifies control of RGB LEDs.
- Colors are defined in **GRB format** (Green, Red, Blue).
- The `chase()` function loops through LEDs, creating a running light by:
  - Lighting one LED with color.
  - Turning off the previous one.
  - Delaying to show motion.

## üß™ Example Animation Logic
```text
1. Initialize NeoPixel strip
2. Define color (e.g., red, green, blue)
3. For each LED:
   - Turn current LED ON with color
   - Turn previous LED OFF
   - show()
   - delay(100)
4. Repeat with different colors
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements

- Add brightness control with a potentiometer.
- Sync patterns to music using a sound sensor.
- Implement rainbow effects or breathing animations.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Power Note

If you're powering a long strip (more than ~10 LEDs), use an **external 5V power supply** with appropriate current rating. Connect all grounds (Arduino, power supply, and strip) together.
