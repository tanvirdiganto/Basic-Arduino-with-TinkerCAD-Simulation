## What is a Potentiometer?

A **potentiometer** (often called a "pot") is a three-terminal variable resistor. At its core, it acts as an adjustable **voltage divider**. By turning a knob or moving a slider, you change the resistance, which in turn changes the voltage on the middle pin.

Think of it like a light dimmer switch or a volume control knob on a stereo. It provides a simple and intuitive way for a user to provide a variable analog input to a circuit.

## How Does It Work?

A potentiometer consists of a resistive element (a track of resistive material) and a sliding contact (the **wiper**) that moves along this track.

It has three pins:
*   **Pin 1 & 3 (The Ends):** These are connected to the two ends of the resistive track. A fixed voltage is usually applied across these pins (e.g., Ground and 5V).
*   **Pin 2 (The Wiper):** This pin is connected to the sliding contact. As you turn the knob, the wiper moves along the resistive track.

When used as a voltage divider, the voltage on the wiper (Pin 2) is proportional to its position along the track.
*   If the wiper is at one end (near Pin 1), the output voltage is close to the voltage on Pin 1 (e.g., 0V).
*   If the wiper is at the other end (near Pin 3), the output voltage is close to the voltage on Pin 3 (e.g., 5V).
*   If the wiper is in the middle, the output voltage is halfway between the two (e.g., 2.5V).

## Key Terminology

*   **Resistance:** The total resistance of the resistive track, measured between Pin 1 and Pin 3. Common values are 1kŒ©, 10kŒ©, and 100kŒ©.
*   **Taper:** Describes how the resistance changes as the wiper moves.
    *   **Linear Taper (B):** The resistance changes linearly with the rotation. Turning the knob 50% of the way results in 50% of the total resistance. Ideal for most sensor inputs.
    *   **Logarithmic/Audio Taper (A):** The resistance changes logarithmically. This is used for audio volume controls because the human ear perceives sound loudness on a logarithmic scale.

## Types of Potentiometers

| Type | Description | Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rotary Potentiometer** | The most common type, controlled by a rotating knob. | Volume controls, light dimmers, tuning knobs. |
| **Slider Potentiometer** | Controlled by a linear slider (fader). | Audio mixing boards, graphic equalizers. |
| **Trimmer (Trimpot)** | A small potentiometer, usually adjusted with a screwdriver. | Circuit calibration, "set-and-forget" adjustments. |
| **Joystick** | Two potentiometers combined to measure X and Y axis movement. | Game controllers, robot control. |

## Basic Wiring (as a Voltage Divider)

This is the most common way to use a potentiometer with a microcontroller like an Arduino.

### Components Needed
*   Arduino Board (e.g., an Uno)
*   A Potentiometer (10kŒ© is a great choice)
*   Breadboard
*   Jumper Wires

### Wiring Diagram

Connect the pins as follows:

```
POTENTIOMETER         ARDUINO
   PIN 1  <-------->    GND
   PIN 2  <-------->  Analog In (A0)
   PIN 3  <-------->     5V
```

**Textual Description:**
1.  Connect one outer pin of the potentiometer to the `GND` pin on the Arduino.
2.  Connect the other outer pin to the `5V` pin on the Arduino.
3.  Connect the middle pin (the wiper) to one of the analog input pins (e.g., `A0`) on the Arduino.

üí° **Tip:** If you find the value increases when you want it to decrease, simply swap the connections on the outer two pins (`GND` and `5V`).

## Code Example: Reading a Potentiometer with Arduino

This sketch reads the voltage from the potentiometer and uses it to control the brightness of the built-in LED on the Arduino.

```cpp
// Define the pins
const int POT_PIN = A0;   // The analog pin connected to the potentiometer's wiper
const int LED_PIN = 13;   // The pin for the built-in LED (most Arduinos)

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication for debugging
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Set the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // 1. Read the raw analog value from the potentiometer.
  // This will be a value between 0 (for 0V) and 1023 (for 5V).
  int sensorValue = analogRead(POT_PIN);

  // 2. Print the raw value to the Serial Monitor.
  Serial.print("Raw Sensor Value: ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);

  // 3. Map the sensor value (0-1023) to an LED brightness value (0-255).
  // The map() function is perfect for this.
  int ledBrightness = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);

  // 4. Print the mapped value.
  Serial.print("\t Mapped LED Brightness: ");
  Serial.println(ledBrightness);

  // 5. Use the mapped value to control the LED's brightness.
  // analogWrite() uses PWM to simulate an analog output.
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, ledBrightness);

  // Add a small delay to make the Serial Monitor readable
  delay(50);
}
```

## Common Applications
*   **User Input:** Adjusting settings like volume, brightness, or contrast.
*   **Sensor Control:** Calibrating sensors or setting thresholds.
*   **Robotics:** Controlling the position of a servo motor or the speed of a DC motor.
*   **Joysticks:** Two potentiometers provide X/Y coordinate inputs.
*   **Music Synthesizers:** Modifying sound parameters like frequency, filter cutoff, and attack/decay.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause(s) & Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Values are noisy or jumpy.** | ‚Ä¢ Poor breadboard connection. Ensure the pins are firmly seated.<br>‚Ä¢ Electrical noise. Try adding a small capacitor (e.g., 0.1¬µF) between the wiper and ground to smooth the signal. |
| **Value is always 0 or 1023.** | ‚Ä¢ The wiper (middle pin) might be connected directly to `GND` or `5V`. Check your wiring.<br>‚Ä¢ The potentiometer may be damaged. |
| **The value only changes over a small part of the turn.**| ‚Ä¢ You might be using a logarithmic taper pot for a linear application.<br>‚Ä¢ The potentiometer could be broken. |
| **The value changes in the "wrong" direction.** | ‚Ä¢ Swap the connections on the two outer pins (`GND` and `5V`). |
