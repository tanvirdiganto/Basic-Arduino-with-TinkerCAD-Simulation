# 📸 Interfacing Photodiode with Arduino

A simple yet powerful project that demonstrates how to use a **photodiode** with Arduino to detect and measure light intensity. Ideal for learning **optoelectronics**, **analog sensing**, and building custom **light-activated systems**!

## 🔧 Required Components

- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- Photodiode  
- 10kΩ Resistor (for voltage divider)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable (for serial communication)

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔦 Photodiode as a Light Sensor

- The **photodiode** is connected in **reverse bias**, forming a **voltage divider** with the 10kΩ resistor.
- When light hits the photodiode, it generates a **small current** due to the **photoelectric effect**.
- More light = more current = higher voltage across the resistor.

### 🔢 Analog Data Acquisition

- The voltage across the resistor is connected to **A0** (analog pin) of the Arduino.
- Arduino uses `analogRead()` to read the voltage and convert it to a digital value (0–1023).

### 🖥️ Real-Time Monitoring

- The digital values are sent to the **Serial Monitor** using `Serial.println()`.
- Higher values = **brighter light**  
- Lower values = **dim or no light**

## 🧠 Applications

- Ambient light sensing  
- Automatic brightness control  
- DIY light meters  
- Light-triggered alarms or automation systems

---

## 📘 Working Principle

The project utilizes the **photoelectric effect** — when light photons strike the photodiode, they generate an electrical current. This current produces a voltage drop across a resistor in a voltage divider, which is then read and interpreted by the Arduino as light intensity.
