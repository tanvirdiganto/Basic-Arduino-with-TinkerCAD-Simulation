Interfacing Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino
This project demonstrates how to interface an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) with an Arduino Uno to measure distance and display it on the Serial Monitor in real time. It is useful in robotics, obstacle detection, parking systems, and automation applications.

🧰 Required Components
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
⚙️ How It Works
🔊 Ultrasonic Signal Transmission
The HC-SR04 sensor has two key pins: Trig (Trigger) and Echo.
The Trig pin is set HIGH for 10µs to send out an ultrasonic pulse.
The pulse travels through the air and reflects back when it hits an object.
🎯 Echo Reception & Distance Calculation
The Echo pin receives the reflected pulse and measures the round-trip time.
Distance is calculated using the formula:
Distance = (Time × 0.034) / 2

0.034 cm/µs is the speed of sound in air.
Division by 2 accounts for the signal traveling to the object and back.
🖥️ Displaying the Distance
The Arduino Serial Monitor prints the calculated distance in real time.
