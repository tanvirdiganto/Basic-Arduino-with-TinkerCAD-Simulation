## üìú Description

This project is a multi-sensor safety device designed to provide early warnings for two common household dangers: fire and gas leaks. It continuously monitors the environment using a temperature sensor (like the LM35) and a gas sensor (like the MQ-2).

- If the ambient temperature rises above a predefined threshold (indicating a potential fire), a bright **red LED** will turn on.
- If the concentration of combustible gas or smoke exceeds a safe level, a **loud buzzer** will sound.

This setup is ideal for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in building practical, life-saving electronic circuits. It serves as a great foundation for more advanced smart home and IoT safety systems.

*This is an example image. Be sure to match the pin connections described above.*

> **‚ùó Important Note on the MQ-2 Sensor:** Gas sensors like the MQ-2 require a "pre-heat" or "burn-in" time to give stable readings. When you first power it on, allow it to run for several minutes to warm up before you rely on its measurements.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```
2.  **Assemble the Circuit**
    Wire up your components on the breadboard as detailed in the [wiring section](#-hardware-setup--wiring) above.

3.  **Setup Arduino IDE**
    *   Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
    *   Open the Arduino IDE.
    *   Select your Board (**Tools > Board > Arduino Uno**).
    *   Select your Port (**Tools > Port > COM...**).

4.  **Upload the Code**
    *   Open the `.ino` file from this repository.
    *   Verify the code by clicking the checkmark icon.
    *   Upload the code to your Arduino by clicking the arrow icon.

## üìà Usage and Testing

Once the sketch is uploaded, the system is active.

1.  **Monitor Sensor Values:**
    *   Open the **Serial Monitor** (**Tools > Serial Monitor**).
    *   Set the baud rate to **9600**.
    *   You will see the real-time sensor readings for temperature and gas concentration.

2.  **Test the Alarms:**
    *   **Fire Alarm (LED):** Gently warm the LM35 sensor with your fingers or a covered heat source (do not use an open flame). When the temperature crosses the defined threshold in the code, the red LED will light up.
    *   **Gas Alarm (Buzzer):** Use a gas lighter (release the gas **without igniting the flame**) or a puff of smoke near the MQ-2 sensor. When the sensor detects a high concentration of gas/smoke, the buzzer will sound.

## üß† Code Logic Explained

The `loop()` function in the Arduino sketch performs the following steps continuously:

1.  **Read Sensors:**
    *   It reads the raw analog value from the MQ-2 Gas Sensor connected to pin `A0`.
    *   It reads the raw analog value from the LM35 Temperature Sensor on pin `A1` and converts it into Degrees Celsius.

2.  **Check Thresholds:**
    *   `if (temperatureC > FIRE_THRESHOLD)`: The code compares the current temperature against a pre-set `FIRE_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 50¬∞C). If it's higher, it activates the fire alarm.
    *   `if (gasValue > GAS_THRESHOLD)`: The code compares the raw gas sensor reading against a `GAS_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 400). If it's higher, it triggers the gas leak alarm.

3.  **Control Actuators:**
    *   If the fire condition is met, it sends a `HIGH` signal to the LED pin (`Pin 7`) to turn it on. Otherwise, it sends a `LOW` signal.
    *   If the gas condition is met, it sends a `HIGH` signal (or a tone) to the Buzzer pin (`Pin 8`) to make it sound. Otherwise, it sends a `LOW` signal to keep it silent.

4.  **Serial Output:**
    *   It prints the current status and sensor readings to the Serial Monitor for debugging and real-time monitoring.
