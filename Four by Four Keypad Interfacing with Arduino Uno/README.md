# 4×4 Keypad Interfacing with Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates how to interface a 4×4 matrix keypad with an Arduino Uno. It detects key presses and displays them via the Serial Monitor. It's a perfect starter for learning matrix keypad scanning and character input handling using the Keypad library.

## 🔧 Required Components

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 4×4 Matrix Keypad  
- Jumper wires

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔌 Keypad Connection
- The 4×4 keypad consists of **4 rows and 4 columns** (8 pins in total).
- Pressing a key forms a connection between a **specific row and column**.

### 🧠 Key Detection Process
- The Arduino uses the **Keypad library** to scan the keypad.
- The function `makeKeymap(keys)` maps physical keys to logical characters.
- The function `kypd.getKey()` checks for active key presses.

### 🖥️ Serial Output
- When a key is pressed, the **corresponding character** is printed on the **Serial Monitor** using `Serial.println()`.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The **Keypad library** handles row-column scanning internally.
- A predefined keymap array (`makeKeymap`) tells the program what value each key represents.
- The system continuously checks for key activity and prints the detected character.
