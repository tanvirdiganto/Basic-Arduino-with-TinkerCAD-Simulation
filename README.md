### What's Inside Each Project?

Every project folder is a complete mini-lesson containing:

-   **üîå Arduino Code (.ino):** A ready-to-use sketch for each project.
-   **üîó Tinkercad Link:** A direct link to a pre-built, working simulation.
-   ** schematic:** A visual guide to how everything is connected.
